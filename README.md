### verify-hubspoke.sh
Infrastructure verification script with animated status checks and network topology display.

**Verification includes:**
- VPN connection status and BGP peering
- Learned BGP routes from both gateways
- Azure Firewall and Bastion status
- VM power states and IP configurations
- Route table validation
- Connectivity testing guidance

## Prerequisites

- Azure CLI installed and configured
- Azure subscription with appropriate permissions
- Bash environment (Linux, macOS, or WSL)
